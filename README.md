Contingent on ThoughtPlot's acceptance of an Order and subject to the terms of the MSA, ThoughtPlot agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to provide the Services subject to the terms of Service Level Agreements. ThoughtPlot retains the right to reject the request for Services by any individual or entity in its sole discretion. ThoughtPlot may change, discontinue, add, modify, re-price or remove features or functionality from the Services upon notice to Customer provided through the Customer Dashboard. It is the Customer's responsibility to review the Customer Dashboard for such notices on a frequent basis. If Customer continues to use the Services following any such modification, such use will be deemed acceptance of such modification by Customer. The Third Party Services are provided by the relevant Third Parties and ThoughtPlot is not responsible for the provision of Third Party Services.

### 2.2 Age.

Customer must be at least 18 years of age or otherwise have the legal capacity to order Services. If Customer is ordering Services on behalf of an employer, company, or other legal entity, Customer represents and warrants that it has the legal right and authority to order Services and be bound to this MSA.

## 3. PRIVACY.

The collection and use of PII is governed by the Privacy Agreement.

## 4. USE OF AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICES.

For downgrades or cancellation of Services, Customer may also cancel Services or perform all downgrades to such Services through the Customer Dashboard or as otherwise designated by ThoughtPlot.

### 4.2 Rights to Use Services.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this MSA (including the Term), ThoughtPlot grants Customer a non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-sublicenseable (except to the extent required to exercise rights under Section 4.2(b)), revocable right in the Services solely to: (a) use and access the Services for internal purposes; and (b) use the Services to create, offer and provide the Customer Offerings.

### 4.3 Customer Obligations

Customer agrees to do each of the following: (i) comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related international anti-corruption laws and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and related copyright laws; (ii) pay the fees for the Services when due; (iii) use reasonable security precautions for providing access to the Services by its employees or other individuals to whom it provides access; (iv) cooperate with ThoughtPlot's investigation of outages, security problems, and any suspected breach of the MSA; (v) comply with all license terms or terms of use for any software, content, service or website (including Customer Content) which Customer uses or accesses when using the Services; (vi) give ThoughtPlot true, accurate, current, and complete Account Information; (vii) keep Customer's Account Information up to date; (viii) be responsible for the use of the Services by Customer and Customer End Users and any other person to whom Customer has given access to the Customer Offering; (ix) comply with the TPS Agreements; (ix) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services and immediately notify ThoughtPlot of any known or suspected unauthorized use of Customer's account, the Services or any other breach of security; and (xi) where the Customer provides Customer Offering as permitted under this Agreement, Customer must enter into an agreement with Customer's End User which shall include the relevant terms of this Agreement and release ThoughtPlot from any and all liability for damages or losses Customer's End Users may incur as a result of using the Customer Offering. Customer may not use the Services in any situation where failure or fault of the Services could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to physical or environmental damage. For example, Customer may not use, or permit any other person to use, the Services in connection with aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, or Class III medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Customer may not resell any of the Services alone to any Third Party without first entering into a reseller agreement with ThoughtPlot.

### 4.4 Special Terms for Third Party Services.

To the extent Customer orders Third Party Services under TPS Agreements, ThoughtPlot is not responsible for such Third Party Services and the provider of the Third Party Service is solely responsible for providing such Third Party Services. However, the Customer also agrees that the following terms of the TOS apply to such Third Party Services: Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 15 and 16.

## 5. PAYMENT.

### 5.1 Fees.

Payment for all fees for the provision of Services such as servers, virtual servers, shared storage and backups shall be due on the next Anniversary Billing Date. One time fees, such as setup fees, bandwidth, storage, administrative fees and late fees, are due and payable when invoiced, and/or as agreed by ThoughtPlot through the Customer Dashboard.

### 5.2 Payment Methods.

The payment shall be made by the credit card (or other acceptable method of payment, in ThoughtPlot's sole discretion) (the "MOP") maintained on file with ThoughtPlot. Customer is responsible to update the MOP periodically and failure to do so may result in the termination of this Agreement and the termination of any Applications owned by Customer in ThoughtPlot's sole discretion. ThoughtPlot is authorized to charge the MOP on file automatically each month on the Anniversary Billing Date for all fees incurred by Customer since the prior Anniversary Billing Date and such authorization may be revoked only prospectively as to fees not yet incurred by Customer.

### 5.3 Taxes.

All prices and fees specified in or referred to in this MSA are stated exclusive of any tax, including withholding tax, sales, use, value added, levies, import and custom duties, excise or other similar or equivalent taxes imposed on the supply of Services. Any sales, use, levies, excise, withholding taxes or similar charges, direct or indirect, applicable or to become applicable, which are levied as a result of the supply of the Services shall be paid by the Customer. Neither party shall be liable for the other party's taxes based on income. If withholding tax applies to any payments for Services made under this MSA, the Customer may deduct such taxes and shall pay such taxes to the appropriate tax authority; provided that Customer shall provide ThoughtPlot with an official receipt for any such taxes withheld and must notify ThoughtPlot prior to payment that withholding tax is required to be paid and Customer shall pay to ThoughtPlot any additional amount to ensure that ThoughtPlot receives the full amount of the invoice. If ThoughtPlot has the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which Customer is responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be charged to and paid by Customer in addition to the amount of the invoice, unless Customer provides ThoughtPlot with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. The parties undertake to cooperate, where possible, to minimize the amount of withholding tax due by making advance clearance applications under the relevant double taxation treaties (where applicable) to the relevant tax authority to reduce the rate of withholding tax or exempt entirely this amount if applicable. In any event, the Customer undertakes to account for any tax withheld to the tax authorities on a timely basis.

### 5.4 SLA Credits.

SLA Credits, if issued to Customer's account, shall be used only to offset future charges for certain Services as provided in the Service Level Agreement. SLA Credits may not be sold, converted to cash or transferred to Third Parties or Affiliates. SLA Credits shall expire on the termination or expiration of the MSA.

### 5.5 Additional Fees.

The Customer's failure to pay any fees on the due date shall result in incurring a late fee of $5 per Application. If ThoughtPlot has suspended the Customer's access to the Services over the Public Network as provided in Section 15, the Customer shall incur a $5 per Application reconnection fee. Such fees shall be due upon receipt, and ThoughtPlot will not reconnect any Services to the Customer until full payment of such fees plus any and all amounts then due for the Services.

### 5.6 Refunds & Disputes.

All fees paid for Services to ThoughtPlot are non-refundable. If the Customer believes that the bills are in error, the Customer's sole and exclusive remedy is to seek SLA credits by sending an email to billing@thoughtplot.io within 30 days of the receipt of the disputed bill, which will open a billing ticket to give notice to ThoughtPlot. Any invoice not disputed by Customer in accordance with this section within 30 days of receipt of the invoice shall be deemed conclusively accepted by Customer as correct. Customer shall not chargeback any credit card payments to ThoughtPlot and any such chargeback will result in an additional payment to ThoughtPlot of up to $500 which is a reasonable estimate of ThoughtPlots's additional administrative costs to contest any such chargeback. Customer is responsible for any fees and costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and collection agency fees) incurred by ThoughtPlot in enforcing collection of fees.

## 6. OWNERSHIP OF SITE.

Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that ThoughtPlot (or its licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Site and the Services provided by ThoughtPlot, including, without limitation, any intellectual property or other proprietary rights which subsist in the Site and Services (whether such rights are registered or unregistered, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). As between Customer and ThoughtPlot, all materials on the Site, including, but not limited to, graphics, user and visual interfaces, images, software, applications, and text, as well as the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, "look and feel", and arrangement of the Site and its content (except for any Customer Content), and the domain names, trademarks, service marks, proprietary logos and other distinctive brand features found on the Site, are all owned by ThoughtPlot or its licensors.

## 7. SECURITY.

ThoughtPlot agrees to maintain reasonable and appropriate measures related to physical security to protect Customer Content. Other than responsibility for physical security, Customer shall be solely responsible for data maintenance, integrity, retention, security, and backup of the Customer Content. ThoughtPlot will take commercially reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of the Customer Content in performing data backup services, which backup services are not redundant, and not geographically distributed. If Customer transfers or is otherwise involved in the transfer of any Customer Content (whether in connection with its business or otherwise) over the Public Network or Private Networks, then Customer is solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations in any and all applicable regions or countries regarding the security, privacy, legality and/or safe handling of such Customer Content.

## 8. INDEMNIFICATION BY CUSTOMER.

Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless ThoughtPlot and its parents, Affiliates, licensors and providers of Third Party Services, and their respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, successors, and assigns, (collectively, the "ThoughtPlot Parties") (ThoughtPlot and each of the ThoughtPlot Parties, an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any and all liability (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any actual or alleged suit, claim, damages, harm, or other responsibility whatsoever ("Claim") arising out of: (a) Customer's use of the Services or Third Party Services; (b) any breach or alleged breach by Customer of this MSA; (c) any breach or alleged breach by Customer or Customer End Users of a Third Party's rights, including, without limitation, any actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of a Third Party's copyright, trade secret, patent, trademark, privacy, publication or other proprietary right; (d) any damage caused by or alleged to have been caused by Customer or Customer End Users to the Site or Services; or (e) any actual or alleged violation or non-compliance by Customer or Customer End Users with any applicable law, court order, rule or regulation in any jurisdiction. The counsel which Customer selects for the defense or settlement of a Claim must be approved in writing in advance by ThoughtPlot prior to such counsel being engaged to represent the Indemnified Parties. Customer shall not in any event consent to any judgment, settlement, attachment, or lien, or any other act adverse to the interests of ThoughtPlot or any ThoughtPlot Party without the prior written consent of ThoughtPlot and/or the applicable ThoughtPlot Party(s). Customer and Customer's counsel will cooperate as fully as reasonably required, and provide such information as reasonably requested, by the ThoughtPlot or the ThoughtPlot Parties in the defense or settlement of any such matter.

## 11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

THOUGHTPLOT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY RELATED TO THE SITE OR SERVICES.

## 12. ALLOCATION OF LIABILITY.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, DISCLAIMER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THE MSA AND IN THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS MSA AND THE ALLOCATION OF RISK HEREIN ARE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WITHOUT WHICH THOUGHTPLOT WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERED INTO THIS MSA. THOUGHTPLOT'S PRICING REFLECTS THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THESE LIMITATIONS.

## 13. TRADEMARKS.

Customer hereby grants to ThoughtPlot a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up license during the Term to use Customer's trademarks, marks, logos or trade names in connection with ThoughtPlot's provision of Services (including support of Services) to Customer and to be listed as a customer of the Services by ThoughtPlot or its designees.

### 16.5 Effect of Termination.

Upon expiration or termination of the MSA, Customer must discontinue use of the Services and relinquish use of the IP addresses and server names assigned to Customer by ThoughtPlot and any other materials provided to Customer by ThoughtPlot in connection with the Services, including pointing the DNS for Customer domain name(s) away from the Services. ThoughtPlot will have no obligation to provide any transition services or access to data except as expressly stated in Section 16.4 above.

ThoughtPlot may assign the MSA to (i) its Affiliates and (ii) any entity as a result of a merger or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ThoughtPlot to such entity and such entity agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the MSA. This MSA will be binding on and inure to the benefit of Customer's and ThoughtPlot's respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. However, ThoughtPlot may use Third Parties or Affiliates to provide all or part of the Services. This provision does not apply to the Third Party Services which are governed by separate agreements.

### 19.6 Force Majeure.

Except for its rights in Sections 15 or 16, neither ThoughtPlot nor Customer will be in violation of the Agreement if the failure to perform the obligation is due to an event beyond either party's control, such as significant failure of a part of the power grid, sabotage, denial of service attack, significant failure of the Internet, natural disaster, war, riot, insurrection, epidemic, strikes or other organized labor action, terrorism, or other events of a magnitude or type for which precautions are not generally taken in the industry; provided however if the force majeure event continues beyond thirty (30) days, the performing party may terminate the MSA.

### 19.7 Feedback.

ThoughtPlot shall own all right, title and interest in and to Feedback. Upon providing the Feedback, Customer hereby irrevocably assigns to ThoughtPlot all right, title, and interest in and to the intellectual property rights in the Feedback and agrees to provide ThoughtPlot with any assistance ThoughtPlot may require to document, perfect, and maintain ThoughtPlot's rights in the Feedback.

### 19.8 Governing Law, Lawsuits.

The MSA is governed by the laws of the State of Utah, exclusive of any Utah choice of law principle that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction, and the laws of the United States of America, as applicable. The application to the MSA of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods is excluded in its entirety. The exclusive venue for all disputes arising out of the MSA shall be in the state or federal courts in Washington County, Utah, and the parties each agree not to bring an action in any other venue. Customer waives all objections to this venue and agrees not to dispute personal jurisdiction or venue in these courts.

### 19.9 Relationship of the Parties.

The parties' relationship is that of independent contractors and not business partners. Neither of the parties is the agent for the other, and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a Third Party.

### 19.10 No Waiver.

ThoughtPlot's failure to exercise or delay in exercising any of its rights under this MSA will not constitute a waiver, forfeiture, or modification of such rights. ThoughtPlot's waiver of any right under this MSA will not constitute a waiver of any other right under this Agreement or of the same right on another occasion. ThoughtPlot's waiver of any right under this MSA must be in writing.

### 19.11 Survival.

All provisions that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination of the MSA shall survive expiration or termination of the MSA.

### 19.12 Integration.

This MSA is the complete and exclusive agreement between Customer and ThoughtPlot regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any agreement, understanding, or communication, whether written or oral, prior or contemporaneous.

### 19.13 Severability.

If any part of this MSA is found unenforceable by a court or other tribunal, the rest of the MSA will nonetheless continue in effect, and the parties agree that any court or other tribunal may reform the unenforceable part if it is possible to do so consistent with the material economic incentives of the parties resulting in this MSA.

### 19.14 Language.

The official language of the MSA shall be the English language and no translation into any other language may be used in its interpretation. All services, support, notices, designations, specifications, and communications will be provided in the English language.

## General Statements.

- Outages. ThoughtPlot servers and networks are monitored 24x7x365 by automated systems. Outages affecting the Services are diagnosed and corrected as quickly as possible. Automated recovery processes resolve many of the issues affecting Customer uptime, however individual applications may not be repaired, and remain the Customer's responsibility.
- Data Backup: Customers may manually Save and Revert to Data Backups via the Customer Dashboard. Automated Data Backups are not currently available through ThoughtPlot. Data Backups will be performed to a shared Managed Backup Infrastructure, and will be retained until deleted by the Customer. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that data is backed up in the event of an outage. There is no resolution guarantee and no guarantee of backup integrity.
- Uptime and Monitoring: Historical uptime, outage, and monitoring information is available at status.bentobox.cloud. We provide this information so that Customers may use it, to the extent that it is helpful, to make their own, independent judgments about ThoughtPlot's relative reliability. We cannot, however, guarantee that our future performance in these categories will equal our historical performance. We can only guarantee that our uptime will be commercially reasonable under the circumstances, and that we will always use our best efforts to minimize downtime.
- SLA Guarantee: If it seems appropriate to us to do so, we may elect to take measures to compensate our Customers for downtime or outages, whether or not the particular incident exceeded our promise of commercially reasonable uptime. In doing so, we are not necessarily agreeing that the downtime or outage was our fault, was unreasonable, rendered the Services unfit for any particular purpose, or that there is or was otherwise any flaw in our Services or the delivery thereof. Any such compensation awarded will be made solely in the form of SLA Credits, and will remain in our sole and exclusive discretion.
- Maintenance: "Maintenance" means:
- THOUGHTPLOT MAINTENANCE WINDOWS: upgrades or repairs to shared infrastructure, such as core routing or switching infrastructure that we scheduled at least 72 hours in advance and that occurs during off peak hours in the time zone where the data center is located.
- SCHEDULED CUSTOMER MAINTENANCE: maintenance of your configuration that you request and that we schedule with you in advance (either on a case by case basis, or based on standing instructions), such as hardware or software upgrades. 
- EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE: critical unforeseen maintenance needed for the security or performance of your configuration or ThoughtPlot's network. We require that all servers remain patched to the approved ThoughtPlot patch level. You are not entitled to SLA Credits for downtime or outages resulting from Maintenance.

## LIMITATIONS ON CREDITS

- Cumulative Dollar Amount: Notwithstanding anything in this SLA to the contrary, the maximum total credit awarded by ThoughtPlot for any calendar month will not exceed 50% of your monthly recurring fee for the affected hosted system.
- Force Majeure/Extraordinary Events: ThoughtPlot will not award credit for downtime or outages resulting from an event of Force Majeure (as described in Section 19.6 of the TOS), denial of service attacks, virus attacks, hacking attempts, and/or any other circumstances that are not within our control.
- Your Breach of the Agreement: You cannot receive a credit if you are in breach of the Agreement at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit until you have cured the breach. You cannot receive a credit if the event giving rise to the credit would not have occurred but for your breach of the Agreement.
- Disabling or Removing of Monitoring or Security Services, Interference with Services: You must notify us in advance if you plan to disable, block, or remove any monitoring or security element of your hosting service for more than thirty (30) minutes. We will not issue you any credit for events that might have been avoided or mitigated if you had not disabled, blocked or removed our monitoring or security elements, or otherwise interfered with our ability to provide the Services.

# ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY

## General Statement.

ThoughtPlot is dedicated to the use of the Internet to improve the lives of individuals throughout the world. Our goal is to deliver enterprise quality on-demand IT Services to all of our Customers at a reasonable price and make available the benefits of the Internet as broadly as possible. The purpose of this AUP is to inform all Customers of the acceptable uses of the Services. ThoughtPlot is committed to encouraging the use of the Internet through its Services and Third Party Services, but such use must be consistent with the laws and regulations governing use of the Internet and must protect the right of its other customers to use its Services. The AUP is designed to achieve these goals. Customer agrees to comply with the AUP and is responsible for the use of the Services and Third Party Services by all entities and individuals whom Customer permits to use the Services, Third Party Services or the Customer Offering. In addition to its rights under Section 19.1 of the Terms of Service, ThoughtPlot has the right to change or modify the terms of the AUP at any time, effective when posted to the Customer Dashboard. Customer's use of the Services or Third Party Services after changes to the AUP are posted shall constitute acceptance of any changed or additional terms.

## Public Network

The Public Network of ThoughtPlot provides public Internet access to Customer servers and data storage services on ThoughtPlot's network. All Customers are granted equal access to the Public Network.

## Private Network

The Private Network of ThoughtPlot provides Customer with secure private network connectivity from Customer's private back end network directly to Customer servers and data storage devices on ThoughtPlot's internal network and to other Services. Customer may use the Private Network to upload/download content, administer Customer servers and data storage devices, transmit information between Customer servers and data storage devices, transmit information between Customer's private back end servers and Customer servers and data storage devices provided by ThoughtPlot, administer the Customer Content, retrieve data, access server consoles, and otherwise manage the Customer Content.

Customer acknowledges and agrees to adhere to the IP Address Policy. All External IP Addresses assigned to Customer are owned and managed by ThoughtPlot, and all internal IP Addresses assigned to Customer are owned and managed by ThoughtPlot. Such IP Addresses are non-transferable, and Customer retains no ownership or transfer rights to such IP Addresses. All IP Addresses are assigned by the ThoughtPlot engineering team on a per VLAN, per server basis. Attempted use by Customer of any unallocated IP Address or any IP Addresses on VLANs not assigned to Customer is a violation of this AUP.

## Normal Methods of Resolution for Violations of ThoughtPlot's Acceptable Use Policy

The goal of our Normal Methods of Resolution is to mitigate service interruptions while resolving potential violations under this AUP. Our sales, support and abuse staffs are dedicated to working with the Customer in resolving potential violations, and are available via support ticket / email. The Normal Methods of Resolution below is provided for informational purposes only and forms the framework and guidance with respect to resolving potential violations. However, ThoughtPlot reserves the right to take immediate action to address any violation of its Acceptable Use Policy at any time in its sole discretion, and you should not assume that any particular violation of the AUP will be handled as set forth below. Even for violations that are handled in accordance with these procedures, timing, order, and speed of these procedures for resolution may differ according to the degree of the violation, the nature of the violation, involvement of law enforcement, involvement of third party litigation, or other related factors.

1. First alleged violation of AUP: a ticket will be generated under ThoughtPlot to provide the Customer's master user with information regarding the potential violation of ThoughtPlot's AUP. This is often a fact-finding email requiring further information or notifying Customer of the potential violation and the required actions to resolve the issue.
2. Acknowledgment of violation of AUP: a ticket is generated under the Customer's user account with information specific to the violation. This ticket will also include any additional facts about the situation and will notify Customer of the action required to resolve the violation.
3. Violation of AUP disregarded, not properly addressed, or continuing violation if a ticket has been disregarded, not properly addressed, or resolved by the Customer for a specified period of time: ThoughtPlot engineers will turn the public network port to the specified dedicated services off. Access to the dedicated services may then be achieved through the secure private service network for Customer resolution. As soon as the violation is addressed, the public access shall be restored and service will continue as normal.
4. Failure to address violation and resolve violation: if Customer fails to address the violation AND fails to resolve the violation, a suspension of services shall occur. This is a last resort for ThoughtPlot and only results when the Customer completely fails to participate in ThoughtPlot's resolution process. A permanent suspension of services includes reclamation of all dedicated services and the destruction of Customer's data.
Disclaimer: ThoughtPlot retains the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse new service to any individual, group, or business. ThoughtPlot also retains the right to discontinue service to Customers with excessive and/or multiple repeated violations.

To demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy, the following agreement has been created to explain our policies and procedures in relation to all data collected. In this Privacy Agreement ("PA") we describe the information that we collect; how we use, disclose, and share your information; and how we protect your information. Capitalized terms not defined in the PA are defined in the Terms of Service. This PA does not apply to Third Party Services which are governed by their own privacy policies.

ThoughtPlot collects data related to our users through the following methods:

- Automated means such as communication protocols and cookies

Depending upon the method of collection and use, the data collected may include information about the User from forms, registrations and transactions (such as name, title, address, company, phone number and e-mail address), financial/transaction information (such as credit card, card verification value (cvv), and payment information), information about use of Site (such as electronic communications protocols, web pages visited, and cookies) and User preferences and privileges.

## ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS AND COOKIES

ThoughtPlot may receive data from you as part of the communication connection itself through the standard electronic greeting between your computer and our servers. This information often consists of network routing (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), internet protocol address, date and time. At this time our server will also query your computer to see if there are "cookies" previously set by bentobox.cloud to facilitate log in or other site navigation procedures. A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store in a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser.

Cookies: Some parts of the Site use cookies (including signup forms) to collect information about visitors' use of the Site and to facilitate return visits. The information collected from cookies is tracked to enhance security and/or to improve the functionality of the Site by avoiding duplicate data entry, facilitating navigation, and increasing the relevance of content.

Cookies on the Site may collect the following information: a unique identifier, User preferences and profile information used to personalize the content that is shown, and User information to access ThoughtPlot's user forums. Some cookies used by bentobox.cloud may remain on the user's computer after they leave the Site, but the majority is set to expire within sixty ("60") minutes. Cookies may also be of benefit to you by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions or preserving order information between sessions. In the future, as we enable further customization of the Site, cookies will help in ensuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs.

Browsers provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used. You can also get information on the duration of the cookie and what server your data is being returned to. You then have the opportunity to accept or reject the cookie. Additionally, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. You can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the Site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature or to provide functionality necessary for transaction completion.

We may also engage Third Parties to track and analyze non-personally and personally identifiable website data. To do so, we may permit Third Parties to place cookies on devices of Users of our Site. We use the data collected by such Third Parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site and to analyze Site usage.

By using the ThoughtPlot Services, Customer represents and warrants that Customer is familiar and will comply with any and all state, federal, or international laws, rules, regulations, decisions, or other principles related to PII or other regulated information which is contained or stored in, processed by, or obtained by any Application or Customer Content which utilizes the Services. Customer will indemnify ThoughtPlot, its officers, employees, shareholders, contractors, and others from and against any suit, claim, damage assessment, or other liability of any kind or sort whatsoever (including without limitation legal fees and costs), which derives in whole or in part from Customer's use of the Services to collect, process, use, store, maintain, or otherwise handle PII or other regulated information.

## THE DATA WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT

ThoughtPlot collects data from users for the following purposes:

- To engage in transactions for service. Name, address, email, purchase details, and credit card/payment information may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history. The majority of the data collected under this category is contact information. ThoughtPlot may need to share some of this data (address, payment) with credit card clearing houses, banking institutions, and other similarly situated Agents, who may require the information in order to complete the transaction (as used here, "Agents" are persons or companies who act on behalf of or under the direction of ThoughtPlot).
- To provide future service and support. Information collected for this purpose is both contact data and information related to products and service/support requested. This information is also used to provide service, product update, and similar notices.
- To select content, data may be collected to help create Site content and navigation that is most relevant and user friendly. This includes data collected as a result of site navigation, as well as data provided in forms.
- To respond to user inquiries and requests for information. This data includes registrations for online newsletters, opt-in mailing lists and specific requests for further information.
- To respond to law enforcement organizations, government officials, third parties when compelled by subpoena, court order, or applicable law, or to report or prevent suspected fraudulent or illegal activity in the use of the Services. ThoughtPlot will notify Customer of the information request or submission as, and if, allowed.
- To our contractors who provide services or perform functions on our behalf.
- If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to another entity if applicable.
- To better tailor marketing to User needs. We may use information from User purchases and User-specified requirements to provide you with timely and pertinent notices of ThoughtPlot product releases and service developments that address your needs and specified requirements and/or which are similar to products and services previously purchased by the User from ThoughtPlot.
- To better respond to requests for service or quotes for product and equipment purchase. ThoughtPlot will pass contact information to the appropriate ThoughtPlot sales person, or reseller for follow-up related to ThoughtPlot products or services.
- From referral "tell a friend" function. If a User elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. ThoughtPlot will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site and send a copy of said e-mail to the User. The e-mail(s) sent shall clearly identify the sender of such email(s). ThoughtPlot uses this data for the sole purpose of sending this onetime email. Such email sent to a friend at User's request will not be stored for additional processing.
- As a result of your participation in interactive discussions and public forums. There are parts of the Site that permit you to participate in interactive discussions. Some of these are moderated; all are subject to access for technical reasons. ThoughtPlot does not control the content that Users post and some may serve as public discussion forums. As in any interactive forum open to many Users, you should carefully consider whether you wish to submit data and should tailor any other content submitted accordingly.

## CUSTOMER DASHBOARD, CUSTOMER CUSTOMIZATION, PREFERENCES AND OPT-OUT

New Customers are automatically registered for access at https://bentobox.cloud/register.html. The Customer Dashboard allows Customers the ability to create accounts and opt in (or out) of Services and mailing lists. The Customer Dashboard provides the Customers with control over their preferences for electronic information delivery.

ThoughtPlot has also provided the Customer's master user the ability to manage the Customer's Account Information. We maintain the data and allow the Customer's master user to update it at any time. To change this information, you must be a current Customer and login with a user ID and password and follow the prompts to "update my profile" on the Customer Dashboard. We continue to expand the profile of Services and information that you may access and update.

Please note that some email communications are not subject to general opt-out. These include communications related to downloads; communications about sales transactions; information about software updates, patches and fixes; disclosures to comply with legal requirements; and network upgrades or other related maintenance for Service.

If an individual's PII is to be (a) disclosed by ThoughtPlot (other than as the result of an Application or Customer Content utilizing the Services) to a Third Party who is not an Agent; or (b) used by ThoughtPlot (other than as a result of an Application or Customer Content utilizing the Services) for a purpose that is incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual, then the individual will be notified prior to such disclosure and may opt-out of the disclosure by responding to the email and/or author of the notification, using any response method designated by ThoughtPlot in the notification.

## SECURITY

ThoughtPlot is concerned with the security of the data we have collected and utilizes commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to that information. These measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, ThoughtPlot uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to facilitate the exchange and the transmission of sensitive data, such as credit card details. ThoughtPlot does not process PII in a way that is incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.

In the event that PII is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, ThoughtPlot will notify the affected individual of the breach by email or ticket on the Customer Dashboard or, if ThoughtPlot is unable to contact the individual by email or ticket on the Customer Dashboard, then by regular mail. Notice will be given promptly, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement and any measures necessary for ThoughtPlot or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of the data system. ThoughtPlot may delay notification if ThoughtPlot or a law enforcement agency determines that the notification will impede a criminal investigation, and in such case, notification will not be provided unless and until ThoughtPlot or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.

## ENFORCEMENT

ThoughtPlot has established internal mechanisms to verify its ongoing adherence to its privacy policy. ThoughtPlot also encourages individuals covered by this privacy policy to raise any concerns about our processing of personal information by contacting ThoughtPlot at the address below. ThoughtPlot will seek to resolve any concerns.

## POLICY UPDATES

If we are going to use your PII in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect the PII already stored in our database, we will notify you by email or post a prominent notice on the Customer Dashboard notifying users of the change. In some cases, when we post the notice, we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. We may update this policy from time to time to describe how new site features affect our use of your PII and to let you know of new control and preference features that we provide.
